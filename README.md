Its a IMDB.com like website with basic CRUD and movie listing using React, Redux, Node.JS, Express and MongoDB.

Relationships
● Actor can act in multiple movies
● Movie can have multiple actors
● Movie has only one producer
● Producer can produce multiple movies

Application specifics
1. Screen to list all movies with Name, Year of release, Producer and all Actors of that movie
2. Screen to ‘add’ a new movie with the necessary fields with existing actors and producers. If the user
wants to add new ‘Actors’ and ‘Producers’ while creating the movie which are not present in the
database then he should be able to do so while being on the same screen.
3. ‘Listing’ screen should allow user to click on ‘Edit’ and edit all the details of the movie and save it
would be a nice to do thing.
